<p>Ok. Ages since i last wrote... college life is too busy at the time, but I haven't been completely inactive - I changed my theme - a new, fresh one. And I came to the conclusion that I needed to really understand how to tweak around with Wordpress settings and also figure out what my blog was to be about.I've been fairly varied in my last(and only) 3 posts.Here goes.I've decided I'm gonna follow a few fairly typical topics - the tech world (impossible to leave it for a geek like me), music, movies,TV series, books I read, recent sports, maybe try my hand at understanding and commenting upon global politics and almost any pseudo-philosophical thought that pervades my mind.</p>
<p>So keep reading!!!</p>
